This is a work in progress. The goal is to build a full product (see PROJECT.txt) including the operational and management functionality that would be needed for a deployed, commercial SaaS.

I decided to make it public against my (ego's) better judgement. You will see all the (hopefully temporary) warts and aborted design directions. 

See NOTES.txt for my moment-to-moment thoughts on the design principles but, in a nutshell, I'm trying to take a functional/data driven approach to make the core messaging as robust, predictable, and efficient as possible.

NOTE: I haven't decided on a license yet. Consider this closed source and proprietary for now though you are free to read the code. Likely I will pick something OSI [https://opensource.org/] approved.
