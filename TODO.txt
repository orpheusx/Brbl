Rcvr
    • configurability (endpoint, connection params, initial log level.)
    • pluggable queue sender impl that just writes to file (part of the test framework?)
    • pluggable queue sender impl that just writes to rabbitmq (replacement for SQS.)

Sndr
    • pluggable client for reading messages from a queue.
    • queue sender impl that writes to activemq queue.

General Needs
    • json formatted message object

=== 04/12/2024 ========

We now have a matched pair of queue components for producing to and consuming from a Rabbit broker.

TODO
Programming stuff:
X integrate them with the Sndr and Rcvr web services.
X implement an "end-to-end" set of components.
    _ implement an integration test that sends strings.
    _ implement test harness that verifies a MO message and response.
_ implement ack logic for the Operator queue client.

_ compose a copyright header snippet and plug it into IDEA.

Deployment DevOps-y stuff:
_ Produce just a few executables (GraalVM compiled) Snd and Rcv could be one, for example.
_ Create dedicated container images for the multiple uses of each executable type.
_ Use something like Docker Compose to set up full developer runtimes.

Technology questions to answer:
_ Telemetry: Helidon supports this out of the box but which implementation should we use?
    _ Prometheus?
    _ Maybe just Graphite for our level of load?
_ Given the non-technical hassles of integrating with Facebook Messenger and the costs of SMS we would like to have our own client platform.
    _ Create our own Web Socket based client? Not an app that requires installing, just a web page. Super light weight with little to no JS.
_ Would it be possible/useful to run a small ML model that could simply understand and categorize incoming questions. The responses would be sent based on the categorization to avoid the response hallucination problem.

_ Testing
    _ JUnit and various mocking frameworks
    _ Playwright (https://playwright.dev/java) for browser support
    _ probably need some pure CLI load/test tools.

_ Client
    _ Elixir and Phoenix LiveView enable low/no-JavaScript clients.
        Pros: Claims great scalability with WebSockets.
        Cons: Requires learning a new language plus a framework for that language.
